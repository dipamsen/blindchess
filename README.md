# BlindChess

BlindChess is a chess application for practicing blindfold chess. The pieces are invisible (can be toggled), and moves are made by typing the algebraic notation. It connects to the Lichess API and provides an alternate client for playing games on Lichess, starting from custom positions against the computer.

The application is built with TypeScript and React, and uses the chess.js library for chess logic and the chessground library for the chessboard UI.
